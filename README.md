# hello-world
My first repository


You won't get much closer
Till you sacrifice it all (all)
You won't get to taste it
With your face against the wall (wall wall)
Get up and commit
Show the power trapped within (in in)
Do just what you want to
And now stand up and begin
Ooo 1, 2, 3, 4 fire's in your eyes
And this chaos, it defies imagination
Ooo 5, 6, 7, minus 9 lives
You've arrived at panic station
